# stripe-checkout

This is a Simple Stripe Checkout Example to Enable Payments in your application.
You must create an account on Stripe for this to work (it is completely safe).

You can use 4242 4242 4242 4242 to test your example (No money is deducted using this).
Make sure to use your own security key from Stripe and make sure you are in test mode.

I have used JS as the front-end use Open with Live Server to run the frontend and npm run devStart to run backend
